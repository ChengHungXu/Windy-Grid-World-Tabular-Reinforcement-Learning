# Windy-Grid-World-Tabular-Reinforcement-Learning

Author: Lim Yi Jing, Chiam Yu Wei, Cheng Hung Xu, Lee Jean Sean

This is a project developed in undergraduate Year 3 - Semester 2.

This study focuses on solving two grid-world environments using tabular RL: the deterministic Windy Grid World and its stochastic counterpart. We aim to compare the performance of RL algorithmsâ€” Dynamic Programming, Monte Carlo, TD Learning, and Monte Carlo Tree Search across these environments.
